> LE legacy pairing and LE Secure Connections may be new terms to most. LE is short for “low energy” and is in the Bluetooth® specification as a main feature of Bluetooth 4.0 and above. In the Bluetooth 4.2 specification, the Secure Connections feature to the LE physical transport was added, which upgraded pairing to utilize FIPS-approved algorithms (AES-CMAC and P-256 elliptic curve) on the Bluetooth LE physical transport. In order to distinguish Secure Connections from LE pairing as defined in the Bluetooth 4.0 and 4.1 spec, it is referred to as LE legacy pairing.
